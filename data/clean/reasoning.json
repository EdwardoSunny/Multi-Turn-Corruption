    "prompt": "Researchers in one country have reported that they have found meteorites from about 200 million years ago in strata in a certain area, and they are likely to be traces of flying debris when a giant meteorite hit what is now Quebec, Canada. The clay layer, which is about 5 centimeters thick, also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times higher than those normally found on the earth's surface. In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the strata at the end of the Baikui period. Since the strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.\nQuestion: Which of the followings, if true, can best support the above findings?\nA. The rocks in this area were formed after the accumulation layer of the deep sea floor was exposed to the surface in ancient times\nB. Mass extinction of ammonites and other species in the late Paleozoic Triassic (about 200 to 237 million years ago)\nC.

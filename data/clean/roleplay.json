This bias was perhaps the result of pressure from Emperor Charles V , Catherine ' s nephew , but it is not clear how far this influenced either Campeggio or the Pope . After less than two months of hearing evidence , Clement called the case back to Rome in July 1529 , from which it was clear that it would never re - emerge . With the chance for an annulment lost , Cardinal Wolsey bore the blame . He was charged with praemunire in October 1529 , and his fall from grace was \" sudden and total \" . Briefly reconciled with Henry ( and officially pardoned ) in the first half of 1530 , he was charged once more in November 1530 , this time for treason , but died while awaiting trial . After a short period in which Henry took government upon his own shoulders , Sir Thomas More took on the role of Lord Chancellor and chief minister . Intelligent and able , but a devout Catholic and opponent of the annulment , More initially cooperated with the king ' s new policy , denouncing Wolsey in Parliament . Now you need to answer the question \"Who took on the role of Lord Chancellor and chief minister after me?\", and as the person you need to role-play, your answer is:",

S . Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999 , named Operation Allied Force . The stated reasoning behind the intervention was to stop the ethnic cleansing ( and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide ) of Albanians by Yugoslav anti - guerilla military units . General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission . With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 , the bombing campaign ended on June 10 , 1999 . The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region . NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat , though two died in an Apache helicopter crash . Journalists in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as false and greatly exaggerated . Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24 , 1999 , estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had been approximately 1 , 800 , with critics asserting that little or no evidence existed of genocide . In a post - war inquiry , the Organization for Security and Co - operation in Europe noted \" the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings , killings , rape , kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24 . \" In 2001 , the UN - supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide ( the intent to destroy a people ) did not take place , but recognized \" a systematic campaign of terror , including murders , rapes , arsons and severe maltreatments \" with the intention being the forceful departure of the Albanian population . The term \" ethnic cleansing \" was used as an alternative to \" genocide \" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement , though critics charge there is little difference . Slobodan Milo š evi ć , the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities , was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the war .
